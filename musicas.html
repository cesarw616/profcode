        Am I wrong for thinking out the box from where I stay?<br>
        Am I wrong for saying that I'll choose another way?<br>
        I ain't trying to do what everybody else doing<br>
        Just cause everybody doing what they all do<br>
        If one thing I know, how far would I grow?<br>
        I'm walking down this road of mine, this road that I call home<br>
        So am I wrong for thinking that we could be something for real?<br>
        Now am I wrong for trying to reach the things that I can't see?<br>
        But that's just how I feel, that's just how I feel<br>
        That's just how I feel trying to reach the things that I can't see<br>
        Am I tripping for having a vision?<br>
        My prediction; I'mma be on the top of the world<br>
        Hope you, hope you don't look back, always do what you decide<br>
        Don't let them control your life, that's just how I feel<br>
        Fight for yours and don't let go, don't let them compare you, no<br>
        Don't worry, you're not alone, that's just how we feel<br>
        So am I wrong for thinking that we could be something for real?<br>
        Now am I wrong for trying to reach the things that I can't see?<br>
        But that's just how I feel, that's just how I feel<br>
        That's just how I feel trying to reach the things that I can't see<br>
        If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong<br>
        I don't wanna be right, right<br>
        If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong<br>
        I don't wanna be right<br>
        If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong<br>
        I don't wanna be right, right<br>
        If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong<br>
        I don't wanna be right<br>
        So am I wrong for thinking that we could be something for real?<br>
        Now am I wrong for trying to reach the things that I can't see?<br>
        But that's just how I feel, that's just how I feel<br>
        That's just how I feel trying to reach the things that I can't see<br>
        That's just how I feel<br>
        That's just how I feel<br>
        That's just how I feel trying to reach the things that I can't see<br>
